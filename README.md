Predicting Fake Job Postings - Data Visualization, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression

While looking for a job recently I came across many postings that seem to good to be true or that just seemed fishy to me. Some that looked legit and that I applied to later turned out to be fake and tried to lure you into signing up for additional services. Hence, this dataset and its potential for a fake job detection really appealed to me.

In this project, I will analyze a kaggle dataset containing real and fake (labeled as such) job postings, their description and further provided details such as title, pay rates, benefits, etc.

First, the data will be rigorously explored by data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

Then, the job descriptions will be TF-IDF vectorized and subject to a logistic regression in order to predict whether a posting is fake or real.
